        <h2> Friday, September 15, 2022: Company Safari </h2>
          <p> When searching for companies in the IT field, immediately three companies popped up in my head. 
            I have searched different jobs in the IT field before starting my study already, to have a look at which fields I could specialize in when graduating.  </p>
          <p> I remember searching for the number one company in the world, in comparison to different factors such as attendance for mental and physical health and ofcourse, salary. </p>
        <h2> NVIDIA </h2>
          <img src="https://logos-download.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Nvidia_logo-700x133.png" style="opacity: 1;">
           <p> If you're into crypto (mining), or just into Computer Science, I'll place a bet on that you know NVIDIA. In short, they are one of the biggest (and most known by public) hardware creating companies worldwide. </p>
           <p> They have also been presented as best software company to work for three times in a row. In short, reading more than 50 (assumable) reviews on glassdoor and indeed, the most important
            demands in my opinion come back every time. They also hold more than 90% market share in supercomputer accelerations and are #3 worldwide listed in Tech Companies. </p>
        <h2> Waze </h2>
          <img src= "https://www.androidhire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Waze-adds-payments-feature.jpg" style="opacity 1;">
            <p> Google this, Google that, any user of the World Wide Web knows what Google is. This company is not just about software but has lots of things to offer. Specifically in the IT field, they are also listed as one of the top employees to work for.
                There are some really good benefits of working at Google, such as, when the employee which works at Google passes away, their partner gets paid their salary for 10 years! 
                Also, their kids get paid $1k in stocks a MONTH until age 19, or 23 if full time students. The salary is also rated as one of the best in IT fields. 
            </p>
        <h2> Kaspersky </h2>
          <img src="https://www.asiapacificsecuritymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Kaspersky-Logo835x396.jpg" style="opacity: 1;">
        <p> This company is not often known by people outside of the IT field. Originally Russian, Kaspersky is a leader in the Cyber Security field. As stated in my motivation,
          I am very interested in (ethical) hacking. Kaspersky is known to focus a lot into specifically the field of (ethical) hacking in Cyber Security. They also offer multiple remote functions.
         The company wakes my interest because in my younger days I've read a lot of articles on their blogs about big (hacking) attacks. </p>
